# mechanistic_modeling_climate

The code provided in this reposistory support the findings of the manuscript *Mechanistic modeling of climate effects on redistribution
and population growth in a community of fish species*, published in Global Change Biology. The sampler is coded in R (`fisheries_fns.R`), which calls custom functions provided in `cpp_fns.cpp`.
